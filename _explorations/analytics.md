#### Google Analytics Review

Google analytics is a great website and tool that many business owners can use
to assess their business. In my case the google analytic data can be used to make
informed decisions. 

This means that it can be used for Menu optimization, we can see how long users spend
on each page of the website. This would identify the top-selling dishes and help in 
understanding customer preferences. Restaurant owners can use this to optimize their
menu offerings to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction

In addition to this we can use the data from google analytics for inventroy management.
Utilizing analytics to track inventory usage can help restaurant owners minimize
food waste and control costs. By identifying trends in ingredient consumption and
forecasting demand, they can streamline inventory ordering processes and avoid 
overstocking perishable items. 

Lastly, using google anaytics gives us an insight into how the companys customers work,
and what their preferences are. We can analyse customer data, such as: demographics, 
ordering habits, and feedback, can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and
behavior. By understanding their target audience better, restaurant owners can tailor
marketing strategies, menu offerings, and dining experiences to meet the needs and
expectations of their customers.
